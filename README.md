# CE417 Artificial Intelligence - Homework Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the homework assignments for the Artificial Intelligence (CE417) course at Sharif University of Technology.

## Course Info

- **Instructors**: Prof. Mohammad Hossein Rohban
- **Semester**: Spring 2023
- **Topics**: Search algorithms, reinforcement learning, Bayesian networks, machine learning, neural networks, etc.

## Homework Assignments

The homework folders are organized by assignment number and contain my solutions in Python.

1. Intelligent Agents, Informed Search, Local Search, Continues Optimization
2. Adversarial Search and CSP
3. Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning
4. Bayesian Networks and Temporal Probability Models
5. Introduction to Machine Learning, Decision Tree, Regression
6. Neural Networks

Each folder has the problem statements in a Problem folder along with my solutions in a Solution folder.

## Running the Code

The code was developed in Python 3.9+. To run a homework solution:

1. Navigate to the assignment folder
2. Ensure you have the required packages installed (simply use colab, no gpu-demanding code here)
3. Run the jupyter notebook, e.g. `assignment.ipynb`
